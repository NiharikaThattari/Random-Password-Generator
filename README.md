# Random-Password-Generator
The goal is to create a random password generator in Python that will help you create secure passwords for your systems. By following a series of easy, simple steps, Python allows you to create random passwords using a combination of alphabets and special characters.
Generating random strong passwords for the end user who intend to keep there data safe. By using this code user can generate random passwords of what ever length they require. 
The random password generated includes the combination of string  ASCII letters which contains the uppercase and lowercase letters and string digits from 0 to 9 and special characters.
The generate_random_password() function includes the main functionality of the program. The main function asks user to enter the length of the password and calls the generate_random_password() function by passing the argument which is length of the password and generate_random_password() generates the password and returns it back to the main function which then prints and displays the randomly generated password to the end user
